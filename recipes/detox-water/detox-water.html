            <h4>Water With a CUH-RAAAZY TWIST (The twist is pseudoscience)</h4>
            <p>It's just water. The additions don't do anything special except add flavor and maybe a calorie.</p>
            <p> Read a goddamn book, perhaps accompanied by a tall refreshing glass of this non-beverage, and thank your liver for *actually* detoxing your body while you're at it.</p>
